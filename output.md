# Output

## Major Steps and Outputs

- Loading Data: The function begins by loading and masking the data using the load_data function. The loaded and masked data (data_masked), the masker object (masker), and the number of scans (nscans) are returned.
- Component Selection: If specified, the function modifies the data based on the selected component ("whole," "positive," or "negative").
- Task Timing Information: If a timings file is provided, the function loads the timing information.
- Correlation Calculation: The function calculates the correlation matrix (corr_map) based on the selected correlation type ("standard" or "window").
- Data Preprocessing: If a processing type is specified (process_type), the function preprocesses the correlation matrix using methods like thresholding (thr), RSS-based selection (RSS), or window-based correlation (window). Visualization of the original and processed matrices is performed.
- Clustering Algorithm Implementation: The function then implements the specified clustering algorithm ("infomap," "KMeans," "Agglomerative," "Louvain," or "Greedy"). If consensus clustering is requested, it uses the Consensus class.
- Visualization: Visualization of matrices, heatmaps, and tables related to the clustering results is performed.
- Saving Maps: If specified (save_maps), the function generates and saves maps related to the clustering results.
- DyneuSR Graph Generation: If specified (generate_dyneusr_graph), the function generates a DyNeuSR graph.
- Summary Output: The function prints a summary on the screen.

The primary output of the function is the visualization of clustering results, including heatmaps, tables, and potentially saved maps.
The specific outputs and visualizations would depend on the parameters provided when calling the function.
